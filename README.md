DriverPass System Software Design.
For DriverPass, their goal was to provide a service for individuals to gain knowledge and experience of driving. The software was meant to help by offering learning services.
The team wanted a system that was accessable from different platforms and allowed users to schedule driving lessons with an instructor. The user was to have the ability to register for an account, log in, view their program progress and schedule/edit/cancel appointments.
For the structure of the system, the team wanted heirarchy levels to ensure that those who need access to system functions are able to access them. There were adminstrative, IT, Office Staff, Teacher and User heirarchies that all had their own capabilities.
The structure of the Diagrams were essential representations of the different functions and structures of the system that can be understood by both team members and non team members.
To further improve on this system, more focus on Security would be beneficial in order to ensure the user's information is secure from attacks.
It is important to cover the user's needs when designing because if the needs aren't met, then changes will be needed later in developments, causing more issues and work. Analysing the needs up front yeilds higher benefits in the long run.
When approaching designing a software, understanding the main goal of the software is my focal point. If I do not understand the overall goal that is looking to be achieved, the focus is blurry and priorities may be weighed differently. Understanding the overall goal, potential growth afterwards and the priorital needs of the user are the key points I focus on first.
